This document is crafted to assist telecommunications and related academic professionals in seamlessly installing, configuring, and extracting results from the Flora simulation environment using the Omnet++ tool. Its purpose is to streamline the process, making it more accessible and efficient for users engaged in telecommunications studies and research.

1-	step, download the tool we use
https://flora.aalto.fi/ 
https://omnetpp.org/ 

2-	With the tool already downloaded, unzip the file, I recommend that you leave the folder for this program directly in C:

 2.1  installation file   
 2.2  initialize this file   


3-	This process will take a few minutes, machines with good processor and memory performance usually do this in 5 minutes
 
4-	At the end of step 3, if a window does not automatically open, simply search for this program omNeT++ 6.0 Shell 
 

This is the window that should appear
 
5-	When this window opens, type the following command ./configure
as in the image below.
Note this process takes a little time, don't worry, approximately 10 minutes.
 

6-	After this process type make
as in the image below.
Note this process takes a little time, don't worry, approximately 10 minutes.
 
7-	When the process ends to call the application just type omnetpp
 
8-	wait to open the application
 
9-	In this step, just follow the environment already created ''samples'', just click on Luanch
 
10-	After following the previous step, this window will automatically appear to start, my recommendation is that you initially install only INET FRAMEWORK, the other option that is marked load other models, uncheck this option, this will make it easier to launch into the flora environment
 
11-	After finishing this step, your work area in omnet will look like this

12-	Installing the Flora Environment
   12.1 - In the upper commands, go to HELP
   12.2- Next comes INSTALL SIMULATION MODELS
 
12.3- install these two templates FLORA and INET FRAMEWORK 4.4.1

13-	At the end of the processes, this will be your work area
